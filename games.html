            <p>Joompy is a FPS/Platformer where you play as an African American cyberagent Whistler hired by an Orthodox institution to 
                <br>destroy a Danish empire that has taken over the world. This game was originally made in thirty minutes, 
                <br>however the game has received updates that have added vast amounts of content. This game was made on a fan-made close sourced Half-Life 2 Beta engine as a 
                <br>test to see how software limitations could affect gameplay, as I could not make any source code modifications.</p>
                <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/joompy-a-half-life-2-beta-engine-platformer" target="_blank">You can download the game for free off MODDB, you must install the 'Mega-Build' from hl2-beta.ru and install it correctly.</a>
